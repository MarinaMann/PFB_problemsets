Today we learn abou tstrings first!

#today we learned about a shit tone of material, that all seems simple on the surface, and is actually quite detailed when you get into it.
##WHat I learned today##
#While loops: Don't attempt to solve/write them after 9pm, preferably 8pm, or your brain will implode.
#Ask the TA's for help before 9pm, so I can listen to their advice and act upon it effectively.

#I practiced counting the elements in strings like sequences, using code

#count the number of each letter in the sequence of DNA
print(DNA.count('A'), "is number of A's")
#where DNA is something like 'atcg' or 'atAT' or 'ATCG'
In order to count the total number of A's, whether upper or lower case, fist convert the whole string to upper case:

DNA.upper() 

#alternativly, replace all the lower cases with upper cases, then simply count all A's.
bigA = DNA.replace('a','A')

#Additionally, I worked with lists vs strings. They are definietly not the same, and have to be accessed and manipulated slightly differently.

#the command below says: create a new variable called "string_taxa_with", by joining together all the individual 'strings' in list "taxa" so there are no spaces and it's one big string, but you can differentiate the old strings using ','
#THis is great because it turns a list into a string
string_taxa_with =  ','.join(taxa)

#The string I made above can be split back apart into multiple strings using the ',' deliminator. 
#Deliminator can be anything, but I"ve chosen the comma.
species = string_taxa_with.split(',')

#Sort and print the list of strings by how many characters are in each string. It automatically sorts shortest to longest.
print(sorted(species, key=len))


Then, we had questions about loops: WHile loops and for loops.

Then, we had questions (homework 3 for today) about dictionaries.
