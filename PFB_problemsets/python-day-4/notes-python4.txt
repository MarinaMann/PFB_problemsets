Python 8 problemset

After our lesson describing how to add error messages and custom error messages, I love the idea, and it's a shame more people can't make thse more readable. 
So, I'm going to try fixing this on my own files at least. 
One of my biggest issues is downloading a file and then not knowing how to get it to run. 
So I've added this paragraph to the beginning of my file, so that if someone opens it, they can figure out how to make it executable:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
  
   """Must initialize file as a python runnable script by the following command:
       chmod +x <file-to-run.py>
     Then retry running the script using ./<script_name.py>"""

Question #1 asks for reading in a file using "user input". To me, this means that from the commandline, the user will run the script followed by the input file name. 
This requires use of the following block of logic: 

import sys
  9
 10 file = ''
 11 try:
 12   file = sys.argv[1]
 13   print("User provided file:", file)
 14   name = open(file,'r')
 15   for lines in name:
 16     lines = lines.rstrip()
 17     print(line)
 18 except:
 19   print("Please provide a file name in commandline, $<script_name.py> <file.in> 

THis block is great because if you try to run the file without providing a file name after the script.py in the command line, it'll return the error "Please provide a file name"

The second part of this question is making the sequences accessible by their ID's, i.e making a dictionary of keys which are IDs, and values wwhich are sequences.

headers = re.search(r'^>.+', lines) 
This search grabs the entire first line of a fasta file header/sequence groups. 
Stores the header in object "headers"
